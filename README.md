* Easy
    - [x] Problem 1
    - [x] Problem 1, bonus (optimized using set)
* Medium
    - [x] Problem 3 (naive solution, without tail recursion, the stack may overflow)
	- [x] Problem 5 (naive solution)
* Hard
    - [x] Problem 2 (using division)
    - [ ] Problem 2, bonus (just a naive version in ***O(nÂ²)***, it could be better than that)
    - [x] Problem 4 (naive linear solution using O(2n) space in worst case)
    - [ ] Problem 4 (linear solution using constant space)
